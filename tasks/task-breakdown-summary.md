## Critical Path Analysis

### Must-Have Dependencies
1. **Phase 1 → Phase 2**: Core infrastructure must be complete
2. **Phase 2 → Phase 3**: Quality content required for AI processing
3. **Phase 3 → Phase 4**: AI features needed for advanced capabilities
4. **Phase 4 → Phase 5**: Optimization required for production

### Parallel Work Opportunities
- Backend and Frontend development can proceed in parallel within phases
- AI/ML work can start planning in Phase 1, active development in Phase 2-3
- DevOps setup can begin early and continue throughout
- QA can develop test cases while features are being built

## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Areas
1. **AI Integration Complexity**: Phase 3 AI work may require additional time
2. **Content Crawling Challenges**: Diverse website structures may cause delays
