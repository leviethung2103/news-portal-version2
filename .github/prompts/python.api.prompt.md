# Python API Testing & Reporting Workflow

This guide describes the workflow for running Python API tests, generating reports, and ensuring best practices for the FastAPI backend.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.12+
- Poetry installed (`pip install poetry`)
- All backend dependencies installed (`poetry install`)
- FastAPI backend running (see project README)
- (Optional) PostgreSQL and Redis running for full integration tests

## Workflow Steps

### Step 1: Prepare the Environment
1. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```sh
   poetry shell
   ```
2. Ensure the backend is running:
   ```sh
   poetry run uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000     
   ```

### Step 2: Run API Tests
- To run all tests:
  ```sh
  pytest
  ```
- To run with coverage:
  ```sh
  pytest --cov=app --cov-report=term-missing
  ```
- To run integration tests (if present):
  ```sh
  python ../../test_integration.py
  ```

### Step 3: Generate Test Reports
- Pytest will output results to the terminal by default.
- To generate a JUnit XML report:
  ```sh
  pytest --junitxml=tests/reports/python-api-report.xml
  ```
- To generate an HTML report (requires `pytest-html`):
  ```sh
  pytest --html=tests/reports/python-api-report.html
  ```

### Step 4: Review and Interpret Results
- Review the summary for passed/failed tests.
- For integration tests, check the printed summary and any error messages.
- Reports are saved in `tests/reports/` for CI/CD and manual review.

### Step 5: Success Criteria
- ✅ All critical API endpoints are covered by tests.
- ✅ All tests pass (or failures are documented and triaged).
- ✅ Reports are generated and stored in `tests/reports/`.
- ✅ Code follows Python best practices and project conventions.

## Example Reporting Template (Markdown)

```markdown
# Python API Test Report

**Date:** 2025-07-26

## Summary
- Total tests: X
- Passed: Y
- Failed: Z
- Coverage: XX%

## Key Results
- [ ] All health checks pass
- [ ] Database setup verified
- [ ] RSS endpoints tested
- [ ] Cron jobs and scheduler tested
- [ ] RSS fetch and article retrieval tested

## Failure Details
- <List any failed tests, error messages, and troubleshooting steps>

## Next Steps
- [ ] Fix failing tests
- [ ] Improve coverage for uncovered endpoints
- [ ] Review integration with frontend
```

## Notes
- For cost optimization and infrastructure analysis, see the Azure workflow in `.github/prompts/python.prompt.md`.
- For code style, follow `.github/instructions/python.instructions.md`.
- For advanced integration, use the `test_integration.py` script for end-to-end checks.
